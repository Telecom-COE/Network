Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing values, scale features, and split the data into training and testing sets.

Linear Regression Model: We'll start with a simple Linear Regression model.

Model Assumptions Check:

Check the residuals for normality.

Verify if there's any autocorrelation of residuals (using Durbin-Watson test).

Homoscedasticity: Ensure that residuals are equally spread across all levels of the predicted values.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, MSE, and RMSE.
