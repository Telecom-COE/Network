Variables and Their Definitions:

Here’s a breakdown of the additional features we will add to the dataset:

Signal Strength (dBm): The strength of the signal in decibels.

Network Latency (ms): The delay in data transmission (in milliseconds).

Packet Loss (%): Percentage of lost packets during data transmission.

Connection Type: Type of network connection (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi).

Network Congestion Level: A synthetic feature that simulates network congestion on a scale of 0–100.

Average Data Throughput (Mbps): Average speed at which data is transferred (in Mbps).

Number of Users: Simulated number of active users on the network.

Network Availability (%): Percentage of time the network is available.

Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR): The ratio of the signal strength to noise strength.

Number of Active Connections: Number of active connections on the network at the time.

Weather (Temperature in °C): Simulated temperature (affects signal strength).

Wi-Fi Interference: Amount of interference from surrounding networks (0-10 scale).

Network Downtime (hours): The number of hours of downtime in a given period.

Customer Satisfaction Score: Simulated score representing user experience (scale 0-10).

Traffic Volume (GB): The volume of data transferred during the observation period.
